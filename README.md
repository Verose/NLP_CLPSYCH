## Abstract

Natural language processing tools are used
to automatically detect disturbances in transcribed speech of schizophrenia inpatients
who speak Hebrew. We measure topic mutation over time and show that controls maintain more cohesive speech than inpatients. We
also examine differences in how inpatients and
controls use adjectives and adverbs to describe
content words and show that the ones used
by controls are more common than the those
of inpatients. We provide experimental results and show their potential for automatically
detecting schizophrenia in patients by means
only of their speech patterns.
